  <title>imake source code configuration and build system</title>
  <description>Imake is a deprecated source code configuration and build system which
has traditionally been supplied by and used to build the X Window System
in X11R6 and previous releases.  As of the X Window System X11R7 release,
the X Window system has switched to using GNU autotools as the primary
build system, and the Imake system is now deprecated, and should not be
used by new software projects.  Software developers are encouraged to
migrate software to the GNU autotools system.
